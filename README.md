  # Hi, I'm Davi.

  ### A software developer and game creator from Brazil 🇧🇷

  I specialize in **Godot (GDScript)** and **Python Automation**.

  > *I love the intersection between code and art.*

  I don't just write scripts; I build tools, create assets, and design systems that feel good to use.
